# DEV Exercise

### Introduction
This repository lays out the foundation to construct front-end templates or components. The idea is to observe how you take what is provided to reach the desired goal for this exercise.

### Goal
The initial goal of this project is to develop a new section for this site following the comp/guideline provided in the *"_comp"* directory and *index* of the exercise. The comp reveals what the final product should look like and what we expect in terms of behavior. Feel free to use any resource for dummy text and images.

### Usage
This exercise assumes that you are already familiar with using the command line. The commands below are intended to help you get started. Once you confirm you have the latest version of NodeJS/NPM installed on your machine, please use the following commands to get you on your way.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/[USER_NAME]/dev-exercise.git
$ cd dev-exercise
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

Once you complete this exercise, go ahead and push all your changes to your repository. Then you will need to create a pull request so that we can be notified that you've completed the excercise for review.

**This exercise should take you no more than a couple of hours to complete. Please have your final version of this exercise pushed to your GitHub account within a 24 hour period of the initial fork then submit a pull request of your master branch and notify your recruiter.**

### Notes
* Use structures of atomic design where possible.
* Make CSS your primary solution to as many possible scenarios before resorting to javascript.
* Make use of the BEM naming convention for css classnames (x-blockName__elementName--modifierName), see figure below for details.
